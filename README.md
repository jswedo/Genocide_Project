Introduction
How to Cite an eBook - like from a Kindle eReader:

You begin citation just like a book citation, and end it with Kindle file (because that is the "format" -- it is not 'print' nor is it 'web').

HOWEVER, if it was an eBook from a database - like our databases at JSerra -- it would be different. THIS citation I will give you is for a Kindle file:

example of a citation:

Rowley, Hazel. Franklin and Eleanor: An Extraordinary Marriage. New York: Farrar, 2010. Kindle file.

Secondly, about the page numbers for the parenthetical citation -- since different ereaders vary in their delivery of page numbers - you cannot use a page number from an ereader - as it could be different for other versions... so you don't do that.

However, you can use a STABLE identifier - like a chapter number.. as chapters do not change from version to version.

so a sample parenthetical would be:

(Rowley ch. 2).
The focus of this project is to begin preparing you for success in college by exposing you to and practicing higher-level writing skills by researching and writing an academic research paper.
 
A proper research paper involves the use of academic sources (print and database), annotated bibliographies, parenthetical citations, and a properly formatted works cited. Remember: Academic Sources do vary from non-academic sources, like popular magazines and the scorned Wikipedia. Therefore, the use of print materials, eBooks, and our EBSCO and Facts on File research databases will assist you greatly during this project. eBooks and Databases are widely used in college and we want you to practice using them now, since we can offer you more support while you learn.
 
Help for each element of this assignment has been provided by your teachers and your librarian. Please consult either your teacher or Ms. Swedo, in the library, if you need any specific help along the way. We are more than happy to assist.
 
Ms. Swedo does answer emails in the evenings and on weekends, if you need help at that time. (jswedo@jserra.org)

Resources
 
Attached at the bottom of this webpage, you will find the following files:
 
The English 2/2H Genocide Research Paper class handouts;
 
You will also find 3 research articles on Genocide that have been pre-selected for your use.
 
Our library has many print books and eBooks, including subject encyclopedia, on these genocides on reserve (in the back, so ask Ms. Swedo to see them) so all the sophomores may use them for the project.
 
The library webpage links you to our EBSCO and Facts on File research databases. You need the passwords to access the login page. These will be given out in your class.
 
This webpage will provide more links to sources that you can use in your research papers. These sources include videos, and webpages that are hand-picked for this project. Please be aware of the standards established by your teacher for the annotated bibliography and the works cited (two separate documents). Samples of how to format both of these documents have been provided to you.
 
For help constructing your works cited entries for this project we would like you to use NoodleTools. Here is a link: NoodleTools.

I. Definition: What is Genocide?
 
From the United Nations
Office of the Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide
 
There is a legal definition of Genocide, which can be applied in international courts.
 
Genocide is:
"...any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group…” including:
 
(a) Killing members of the group;
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
 
All such acts are violations of human rights, and may also be crimes against humanity or war crimes, depending on the context in which they were committed.
 
The Convention confirms that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or war, is a crime under international law which parties to the Convention undertake 'to prevent and to punish' (article 1).
 
Because it is a part of international customary law the Convention is considered applicable in all countries, irrespective of whether they have signed or ratified it."
 
--------------------------
 
Please remember this definition as you go through this Genocide Project, as you will be applying it in your last post on the Ning and will be discussing this in your research paper.

III. General Sources for Use in Research
 
Remember!! When selecting sources to use for this project, you are required to use Authoritative Sources, not "junky" sources like Wikipedia, NationMaster (another wiki), and websites where authorship or sponsorship is not verifiable. This is a preliminary list of sources to get you started. We encourage you to find sources on your own. If you have questions about authenticity, accuracy, or currency of sources you are considering, please contact your librarian. jswedo@jserra.org
 
Suggested general sources for this project include, but are not limited to:
 
Books Sources:

    Print books or eBooks in our library, or books at your local library
    Popular magazines like Time or Newsweek

Research Databases:
 
EBSCO has various databases which have authoritative journal articles.
 
When using database articles, they must be CITED as a library database. This will be discussed in class. Please use the citations embedded in each EBSCO article for your citation. EBSCO gives you the fully formatted citation to copy-and-paste into your works cited list.
 
Databases are widely used in college and are considered to ALWAYS be authoritative in nature. Please use them. The EBSCO login page is on the front page of the library. Here is a direct Link: EBSCO Login.
